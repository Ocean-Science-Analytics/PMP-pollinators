# PMP-pollinators
This repository contains details of the analysis and process of the ESIP supported project "Insect Pollinator Network Composition in Post-Fire Recovery of Coastal Sage Scrub." In this project we evaluate the the influence of several factors on the pollinating insect assemblage in post-fire Coastal Sage Scrub habitat in three sites in San Diego County. In this study, we are examining how burn interval or frequency, or abundance or distance of reservoir habitat may impact the diversity of flower-visiting insects.  We approach this project through a combination of focal observation monitoring, application of the InVEST pollination model to evaluate honeybees versus all other insect pollinators, and ancillary video data collection to augment observations.

## Project Information
This repository contains the input data used in the InVEST Crop Pollination model, the focal observation data collected for all sites, the model results, and a project report. Information is organized into the following folders:
- InVEST_Data: Includes inputs required for Crop Pollination model modified to evaluate "Bees" and "All Other Pollinators" for this project: guild table, landcover biophysical table and landcover tif file. 
- InVEST_Results: Outputs derived from the best model including a log file, the pollinator supply tif file for bees and all other pollinators, and exported polygon files based on those rasters for six-kilometer radius regions surrounding each site.
- Observation_Data: CSV file of insect-plant observations collected at each site
