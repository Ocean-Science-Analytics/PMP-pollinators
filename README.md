# PMP-pollinators
This repository contains details of the analysis and process of the ESIP supported project "Insect Pollinator Network Composition in Post-Fire Recovery of Coastal Sage Scrub." In this project we evaluate the the influence of several factors on the pollinating insect assemblage in post-fire Coastal Sage Scrub habitat in three sites in San Diego County. In this study, we are examining how burn interval or frequency, or abundance or distance of reservoir habitat may impact the diversity of flower-visiting insects.  We approach this project through a combination of focal observation monitoring, application of the InVEST pollination model to evaluate honeybees versus all other insect pollinators, and ancillary video data collection to augment observations.
